This is at least the fourth attempt of me trying to create a website including a blog. Want to know how often I managed to publish something? Not a single time. That's exactly where this post comes into play. I am writing this post to remove the barrier of wanting to create a blogpost which is "worthy" to be the first one. 

I guess not wanting to create an unworthy first blogpost is just another one of those firsts. Firsts don't have to be special at all but wanting it to be special creates a barrier some may never be able to surpass. But this is it! I'm done! Took me literally 5 minutes. Let this be an inspiration for you to just get one of your firsts out of the way. Let it be a profane first. It'll be okay. I know this post isn't perfect at all but at least I might be able to see some progression in the future.

You're probably wondering what untalented dumbass wrote that piece of cringe above. That's me! 

I'm Jakob, 20 years old and am currently studying computer science and media at Stuttgart Media University. In my freetime, I like to write and contribute to free software, read a book or try aquiring old stuff like the old typewriter I aquired for 3 Euros. There may be a future blogpost about the latter if I manage to get it fully working again (worked once, broke it again).

Let's hope that this won't be the last post on this very blog. Otherwise, feel free to check out my Twitter account or my projects on GitHub.

Bye!
